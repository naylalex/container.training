# Custom Resource Definitions

- CRDs are one of the (many) ways to extend the API

- CRDs can be defined dynamically

  (no need to recompile or reload the API server)

- A CRD is defined with a CustomResourceDefinition resource

  (CustomResourceDefinition is conceptually similar to a *metaclass*)

---

## Creating a CRD

- We will create a CRD to represent different recipes of pizzas

- We will be able to run `kubectl get pizzas` and it will list the recipes

- Creating/deleting recipes won't do anything else

  (because we won't implement a *controller*)

---

## First slice of pizza

```yaml
@@INCLUDE[k8s/pizza-1.yaml]
```

---

## The joys of API deprecation

- Unfortunately, the CRD manifest on the previous slide is deprecated!

- It is using `apiextensions.k8s.io/v1beta1`, which is dropped in Kubernetes 1.22

- We need to use `apiextensions.k8s.io/v1`, which is a little bit more complex

  (a few optional things become mandatory, see [this guide](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/deprecation-guide/#customresourcedefinition-v122) for details)

- `apiextensions.k8s.io/v1beta1` is available since Kubernetes 1.16

---

## Second slice of pizza

- The next slide will show file @@LINK[k8s/pizza-2.yaml]

- Note the `spec.versions` list

  - we need exactly one version with `storage: true`

  - we can have multiple versions with `served: true`

- `spec.versions[].schema.openAPI3Schema` is required

  (and must be a valid OpenAPI schema; here it's a trivial one)

---

```yaml
@@INCLUDE[k8s/pizza-2.yaml]
```

---

## Baking some pizza

- Let's create the Custom Resource Definition for our Pizza resource

.lab[

- Load the CRD:
  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f ~/container.training/k8s/pizza-2.yaml
  ```

- Confirm that it shows up:
  ```bash
  kubectl get crds
  ```

]

---

## Creating custom resources

The YAML below defines a resource using the CRD that we just created:

```yaml
kind: Pizza
apiVersion: container.training/v1alpha1
metadata:
  name: napolitana
spec:
  toppings: [ mozzarella ]
```

.lab[

- Try to create a few pizza recipes:
  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f ~/container.training/k8s/pizzas.yaml
  ```

]

---

## Type validation

- Older versions of Kubernetes will accept our pizza definition as is

- Newer versions, however, will issue warnings about unknown fields

  (and if we use `--validate=false`, these fields will simply be dropped)

- We need to improve our OpenAPI schema

  (to add e.g. the `spec.toppings` field used by our pizza resources)

---

## Third slice of pizza

- Let's add a full OpenAPI v3 schema to our Pizza CRD

- We'll require a field `spec.sauce` which will be a string

- And a field `spec.toppings` which will have to be a list of strings

.lab[

- Update our pizza CRD:
  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f ~/container.training/k8s/pizza-3.yaml
  ```

- Load our pizza recipes:
  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f ~/container.training/k8s/pizzas.yaml
  ```

]

---

## Viewing custom resources

- By default, `kubectl get` only shows name and age of custom resources

.lab[

- View the pizza recipes that we just created:
  ```bash
  kubectl get pizzas
  ```

]

- Let's see how we can improve that display!

---

## Additional printer columns

- We can tell Kubernetes which columns to show:
  ```yaml
    additionalPrinterColumns:
    - jsonPath: .spec.sauce
      name: Sauce
      type: string
    - jsonPath: .spec.toppings
      name: Toppings
      type: string
  ```

- There is an updated CRD in @@LINK[k8s/pizza-4.yaml]

---

## Using additional printer columns

- Let's update our CRD!

.lab[

- Update the CRD:
  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f ~/container.training/k8s/pizza-4.yaml
  ```

- Look at our Pizza resources:
  ```bash
  kubectl get pizzas
  ```

]

Note: we can update a CRD without having to re-create the corresponding resources.

(Good news, right?)

---

## Better data validation

- Let's change the data schema so that the sauce can only be `red` or `white`

- This will be implemented by @@LINK[k8s/pizza-5.yaml]

.lab[

- Update the Pizza CRD:
  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f ~/container.training/k8s/pizza-5.yaml
  ```

]

---

## Validation *a posteriori*

- Some of the pizzas that we defined earlier *do not* pass validation

- How is that possible?

--

- Validation happens at *admission*

  (when resources get written into the database)

- Therefore, we can have "invalid" resources in etcd

  (they are invalid from the CRD perspective, but the CRD can be changed)

ðŸ¤” How should we handle that ?

---

## Versions

- If the data format changes, we can roll out a new version of the CRD

  (e.g. go from `v1alpha1` to `v1alpha2`)

- In a CRD we can specify the versions that exist, that are *served*, and *stored*

  - multiple versions can be *served*

  - only one can be *stored*

- Kubernetes doesn't automatically migrate the content of the database

- However, it can convert between versions when resources are read/written

---

## Conversion

- When *creating* a new resource, the *stored* version is used

  (if we create it with another version, it gets converted)

- When *getting* or *watching* resources, the *requested* version is used

  (if it is stored with another version, it gets converted)

- By default, "conversion" only changes the `apiVersion` field

- ... But we can register *conversion webhooks*

  (see [that doc page](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/extend-kubernetes/custom-resources/custom-resource-definition-versioning/#webhook-conversion) for details)

---

## Migrating database content

- We need to *serve* a version as long as we *store* objects in that version

  (=as long as the database has at least one object with that version)

- If we want to "retire" a version, we need to migrate these objects first

- All we have to do is to read and re-write them

  (the [kube-storage-version-migrator](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kube-storage-version-migrator) tool can help)

---

## Even better data validation

- If we need more complex data validation, we can use a validating webhook

- Use cases:

  - validating a "version" field for a database engine

  - validating that the number of e.g. coordination nodes is even

  - preventing inconsistent or dangerous changes
    <br/>
    (e.g. major version downgrades)

  - checking a key or certificate format or validity

  - and much more!

---

## CRDs in the wild

- [gitkube](https://storage.googleapis.com/gitkube/gitkube-setup-stable.yaml)

- [A redis operator](https://github.com/amaizfinance/redis-operator/blob/master/deploy/crds/k8s_v1alpha1_redis_crd.yaml)

- [cert-manager](https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/releases/download/v1.0.4/cert-manager.yaml)

*How big are these YAML files?*

*What's the size (e.g. in lines) of each resource?*

---

## CRDs in practice

- Production-grade CRDs can be extremely verbose

  (because of the openAPI schema validation)

- This can (and usually will) be managed by a framework

---

## (Ab)using the API server

- If we need to store something "safely" (as in: in etcd), we can use CRDs

- This gives us primitives to read/write/list objects (and optionally validate them)

- The Kubernetes API server can run on its own

  (without the scheduler, controller manager, and kubelets)

- By loading CRDs, we can have it manage totally different objects

  (unrelated to containers, clusters, etc.)

---

## What's next?

- Creating a basic CRD is relatively straightforward

- But CRDs generally require a *controller* to do anything useful

- The controller will typically *watch* our custom resources

  (and take action when they are created/updated)

- Most serious use-cases will also require *validation web hooks*

- When our CRD data format evolves, we'll also need *conversion web hooks*

- Doing all that work manually is tedious; use a framework!
